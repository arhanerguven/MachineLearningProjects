The projects in this folder will be using YOLO Object Detection algorithm and/or Object Trackers. 

-Yolo_and_Tracker.py --->In this project YOLOv3 algorithm is used to detect and classify objects in a given video. After clicking the mouse at a desired time, YOLO algorithm passes one of the bounding boxes to the object tracker.
After this step, CSRT Tracker is responsible of tracking the object detected by YOLO. A YOLOv3 code found on the internet was edited to get the desired result.
