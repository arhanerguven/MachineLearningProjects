This folder includes CNN projects that I have done using keras. 

-VGG-16.py ---> This project is the implementation of the famous VGG-16 architecture using Keras.
-small.py ---> This project is a relatively simple CNN architecture that includes Dropout, Batch Normalization layers. Also, L1 optimizer is used. 
Different methods such as L2 optimizer, Layer Normalization layers were used and their performances were compared in the graphs given above.
